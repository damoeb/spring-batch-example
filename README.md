spring-batch-example
====================

This is a simple example for spring batch 3.0 based on just two classes. Thanks to http://www.jroller.com/0xcafebabe/entry/spring_batch_hello_world_1 

The implementation is completely annotation based (no applicationContext.xml) and demonstrates a Flow or SimpleJob.

Just run the main in BatchConfiguration.
